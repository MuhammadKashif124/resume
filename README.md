GenerativeAI FastAPI Server
This repository contains a FastAPI server that utilizes the GenerativeAI API to generate creative text formats of text content, like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.,  based on user prompts. The server exposes an endpoint that accepts user prompts and returns the generated content.

Setup

Clone the Repository:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/topics/generative-ai
Use code with caution.
Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have Python installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and install required dependencies using pip:

Bash
cd generativeai-fastapi-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Configure API Key:

Obtain an API key from the GenerativeAI platform and configure it in the code. Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in genai.configure(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY") with your actual key.

Run the Server:

Start the FastAPI server by running the main script:

Bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
Use code with caution.
Usage

Once the server is running, send HTTP POST requests to the /generate_response/ endpoint with a JSON payload containing the user prompt. The server will generate content based on the prompt and return it in the response body.

Example:

JSON
POST /generate_response/

{
  "prompt": "Write a poem about a robot who falls in love with a human."
}
Use code with caution.
